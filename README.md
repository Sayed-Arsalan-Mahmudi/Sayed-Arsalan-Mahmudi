🧑‍💻 Hi, I'm Sayed Arsalan Mahmudi. I'm currently studying in Türkiye. 🧑‍💻
My journey in development started with 😺 Scratch projects, then grew into learning HTML and CSS. After that, I moved on to 🐍 Python and began exploring web development more deeply.
I’m now learning 🌐 full-stack web development through hands-on projects — starting from Python and expanding into JavaScript and everything that connects the web together.
I enjoy turning ideas into simple, functional, and meaningful code.
Every commit is a small step forward.
