Hi, I'm Sayed Arsalan Mahmudi. I'm currently studying in Türkiye.
My journey in development started with Scratch projects, then grew into learning HTML and CSS. After that, I moved on to Python and began exploring web development more deeply.
I’m now learning full-stack web development through hands-on projects — starting from Python and expanding into JavaScript and everything that connects the web together.
I enjoy turning ideas into simple, functional, and meaningful code.
Every commit is a small step forward.
